To create the virtual environment (.venv):

```python -m venv .venv```

To activate the virtual environment (on windows):

```.venv\Scripts\activate ```

To install pandas

```pip install pandas```

```pip install openpyxl```

For those who want a cleaner job, instead of using the two precedent commands
to install pandas and openpyxl you could run the next command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
